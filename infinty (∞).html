<H2><P> When I heard about infinity I knew that it is one of the interesting concept in mathematics . According to me, it is undefined . It may be any number like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,... or a billion or a trillion or more.</P></H2><BR>

<H2> There is a question - is 0/0 = ∞ ?<BR>
I think yes 0/0 = ∞ because<BR>

1*0=0<BR>
1=0/0<BR>

10*0=0<BR>
10=0/0<BR>

100*0=0<BR>
100=0/0<BR>

like this it can go to the infinity.<BR>
So, My answer is yes.</H2><BR>

<H2> There is one more question - is n/0 = ∞<BR>
I think yes it is because<BR>

1/1=1<BR>
1/0.1=10<BR>

1/0.01=100<BR>
1/0.001=1000<BR>

1/0.0001=10000<BR>
1/0.00001=100000<BR>

like this when 0 will come, infinity will be the answer.<BR>
And if you practically divide it then also the answer will infinity.<BR>
So, My answer is yes.</H2><BR>

<H2> There is one thing - 0/n = 0<BR> 
It is true and proved.<BR>

1*0=0<BR>
0=0/1<BR>

10*0=0<BR>
0=0/10<BR>

100*0=0<BR>
0=0/100<BR>

like this whenever any number divided by 0 the quotient will also 0.<BR>
So, My answer is yes.</H2><BR>

<H2><CENTER> THIS ALL IS MY THEORY ABOUT INFINITY (∞) MAYBE CORRECT MAYBE WRONG.</H2></CENTER>
